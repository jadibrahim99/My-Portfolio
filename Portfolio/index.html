      <img src="assets/images/i.png" class="auth-image" alt="Jad Ibrahim">

      <p>I'm an aspiring freelance web developer, but current General Manager of a restaurant called Zaxby's.</p>

      <p>I played football all of my life up until I graduated high school, so I naturally love to watch football. I grew up watching Ben Roethlisberger and Troy Polamalu win 2 Super Bowls and play in 3, so naturally I'm a Steelers fan. I also hate the Cowboys.  </p>

      <p>I enjoy watching basketball, and gaming. I've been working with and around computers since since I was 6 years old. I learned how to build a computer when I was just 6 years old and ever since then I was hooked.</p>
